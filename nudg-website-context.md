# Nudg Website Project Context

## What is Nudg?

Nudg is a mobile iOS app that helps small service businesses generate more Google reviews by automatically texting customers after a completed service. The core workflow: business owner enters a customer's phone number → automated SMS asks for a 1-5 rating → positive ratings (4-5) get a Google Review link → negative ratings (1-3) route private feedback to the business owner's inbox for follow-up.

Target audience: Single-owner local service businesses (plumbers, barbers, dentists, cleaners, etc.)

## Site Sections & Content

### 1. Hero Section
- Bold headline communicating the core value: "Turn every happy customer into a Google review"
- Subheadline: emphasize simplicity — "One text. One tap. More reviews."
- App Store download button (primary CTA)
- Hero image: phone mockup showing the app in action

### 2. How It Works (3-Step Flow)
Visual step-by-step:
1. **Send a text** — After a service, enter your customer's phone number and tap send
2. **Customer rates** — They reply with a rating from 1-5 via text message
3. **Reviews grow** — Happy customers (4-5) get your Google Review link. Unhappy ones (1-3) send you private feedback to fix.

### 3. Features Section
Key features to highlight:

- **One-Tap SMS Requests** — Just enter a phone number. Optional customer name and service type. That's it.
- **Smart Routing** — Positive ratings → Google Reviews. Negative ratings → Private feedback inbox. Automatically.
- **Real-Time Dashboard** — See reviews sent, positive responses, needs attention count, and month-over-month growth at a glance.
- **Feedback Inbox** — View negative feedback, call customers directly, mark issues resolved. All in one place.
- **Push Notifications** — Get alerted within 60 seconds of new feedback or when you're approaching your SMS limit.
- **Offline Resilient** — Forms are cached locally. Failed sends retry automatically with exponential backoff. Nothing gets lost.
- **Secure by Default** — AES-256 encryption for all customer data. Audit logging. GDPR-style deletion on request.
- **Duplicate Protection** — Warns you if a customer was already texted in the last 24 hours.
- **Conversation Expiry** — Customers have 72 hours to respond. After that, the conversation closes automatically.
- **Invalid Response Handling** — If a customer sends something other than 1-5, we ask once more. After 2 invalid attempts, we politely end the conversation.

## Design Notes for Website

- Use phone mockups showing actual app screens (Dashboard, Send Request, Inbox)
- Animate the 3-step flow if possible (subtle, not flashy)
- Large, readable text — the site itself should feel as simple as the app
- Navy background sections with white/teal text for contrast
- White sections with navy text for readability
- Teal for CTAs and interactive elements
- Card-style feature blocks on light gray or mint backgrounds
- Mobile-responsive (site should look great on phones since users will find it via App Store link searches)
- Fast — aim for 100 Lighthouse performance score (static site, should be easy)
